[dininghall]
1 = The dining hall is an absolute mess. Food and shells cover the floor. There is the faint smell of blood.

[figherbay]
1 = The fighter bay is in flames. It appears as though several fighters attempted to take off, but were shot down and crashed in various areas around the hangar. On the wall, painted in blood is, "NO SURVIVORS".

[dropship]
1 = The dropship is relatively intact suprisingly, given the condition of the rest of the Aurora. You peer inside the ramp and see that the ship has been gutted and is empty.

[logi]
1 = You stroll down the hallway to the logistics bay. The door has been forced open, and is dented on either end of the parts facing each other, as if there was a forced entry. Peering in the gaping hole in the door, you smell blood and gunpowder.

[reactor]
1 = test

[shiphangar]
1 = You stumble over to the ship hangar. Your head hurts and your forehead is bleeding from a laceration you don't remember getting. There are a few drop-ships stored in the ship hangar, but they're all on fire.

[cq]
1 = You stroll over to the captain's bay. There is a hole in his door, with fragments of metal and bullet shells loitering the floor. There was a struggle. Several dents mark the wall where the Captain was seemingly slammed around in the fight for his life.

[bridge]
1 = You walk through the captain's door, to the bridge. All of the heads-up displays and various consoles showing information about the ship are shattered.

[bathroom]
1 = test

[barracks]
1 = The barracks smells of rotting flesh and gunpowder. Some men lay dead in their bed, shot in various places. You see your friend slumped against the wall. Poor guy.
